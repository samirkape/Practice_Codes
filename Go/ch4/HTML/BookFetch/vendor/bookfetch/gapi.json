Ninety-six percent of employers argue that it's not just about having the right skills for the position- it's all about the right mindset. As two leading experts on the subject, Reed and Stoltz know what employers really want from the people they hire and keep. According to their extensive and globally acclaimed research, there is a specific set of mental traits that will make you exponentially more desirable to potential employers, and more likely to succeed and enjoy your job once you're hired. This \"3G Mindset\" is: ? Global-the openness and big-picture perspective to compete on a global scale in any job ? Good-a positive force with an unwavering moral compass ? Grit-the tenacity and resilience to thrive on adversity The authors reveal why employers are three times more likely to hire people with the right mindset over those who are more qualified on paper. This book provides an actionable approach for both assessing and developing these essential traits.",
